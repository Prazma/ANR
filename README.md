## Nuclear Power plant automation by AI on the web
This project uses simple back-propagation implemented JavaScript to achieve an accurate automation. Therefore, this project was aimed to commit to the space development and exploration in terms of sustainable energy source.
### Why AI Automation?
Machines such as rovers can be sent to an extraterrestrial planet such as Mars, while humans cannot yet be sent. Therefore, we must have a program (machine) which is able to control and maintain the power plant based on the demand of electricity needed, and as well as the safety measures needed to be concerned. This project aims to create an over 95% accurate control platform.
### How do we train the program?
Although we cannot afford to build a whole powerplant, we can surely create a full simulation based on the systems and concept the actual power plant uses. We have also implemented the data for changes in demand regarding to consumer behavior by the source University of Manchester, and have calculated the possible range of demand to generate random seed for user demand data and graph. The AI priority is to control the power plant from two attributes: steam output and control rod position to generate the right amount of electricity demanded by the consumer.
